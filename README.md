# About (from the original)

Ioreth is a **very experimental** APRS bot. There are a lot of things to be
done yet, including writing the documentation. For now, you are welcome to
use it as you want.

Note that transmitting on the usual APRS ham bands requires (at least) an
Amateur Radio license and additional conditions and limitations for this
particular mode of operation may apply on your country or region. You MUST
ensure compliance with your local regulations before transmitting, but all
other uses are only subjected to the GNU GPLv3+ (see license bellow).

Connecting this program to the APRS-IS network also requires a license as
you will be, effectively, operating remote transmitters through the Internet.

# Updates to original (by Wayne Spivak, KC2NJV)

<b>Installation and Notes:</b>  

Read the requirements file.  I had to load 99% in a virtual environment and run the program in the same environment.  The replybot.service is configured that way.

Put eveything in /opt/aprsbot.  I don't think there is anything hard-coded in Bot.py (some fallbacks), but everything is in aprsbot.conf.

Some other scripts, like the service scripts, the tatical_text_msg.py and tatical_beacon.py, at_aprs_send.sh and random_aprs_scheduler.sh (make exec) need some info customized. trim_audit_logs.py also need some slight modification.

The log.html file, (make it to your liking, maybe as a php file..) and check the aprsapi.service file to obtain the logs.  You will need to install gunicorn and probably nginx.

Add the following cron jobs 

     #send beacon
     
     */3 * * * * /usr/bin/python /opt/aprsbot/ioreth/tatical_beacon.py  >/dev/null 2>&1
     
     #Trim audit_log

     0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/aprsbot/trim_audit_logs.py

     #Run auto-random messages to your list:

     1 0 * * * /opt/aprsbot/random_aprs_scheduler.sh

     # Optional other meesages use this syntax:
     
     0 */2 * * * cd /opt/aprsbot; python -m ioreth.tatical_text_msg  <Your sending Callsign/Tatical Callsign> "MSG your message" >/dev/null 2>&1


<b>Addtional Changes to the Orginal:</b>

Logger provides timestamps

SQLite3 databases for users, blacklisted callsigns and admins (with timestamps), audit_log

Blacklist limited to Admins, is manually added and is normalized, i.e.; callsign AB2xyz will block all AB2xyx-xx.

Public logging via the DB, based on the full audit trail.  

As mentioned: Logging handled by gunicorn, a service is supplied (check paths). Api.py and basic HTML page supplied.  You should use nginx for the proxy between log.php and api.py.

Added code to prevent loopback (deduplication) from sent messages

Anyone sending HELP to an alias for the list will recieve a response, unless they are blacklisted.

Configurable in aprsbot.conf:
Added configurable Welcome message for new subscribers
Callsign, Callsign Alias, List Names, DB name.
Configurable Beacon text
Configurable Known Commands
Deduplication time value

Other items (some repeated):

Added a beacon (tatical_beacon.py) which will enable APRS-IS only devices to find your tactical callsign (add a cronjob @15min intervals).

Added a script to trim audit_log in SQLite3 db.  Just add a cron job.

Added a db to keep deduplication persistent over bot reboots.  

Relaybot.service to automatically start (on my system I had to run python in a virtual environment)

To create or delete ADMINS, I have remvoed this facility.  I suggest you use sqlite3 and use
a) To Add:
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO admins (callsign) VALUES (?)"
b) To Delete:
     "DELETE FROM admins WHERE callsign = ?"
     
<b>New/Changed Commands:</b>

<b>NOTE:</b> Commands are not case sensitive (given my radios, that would be insane :) )

CQ [space] [listname] [message] <-- listname is configured in APRSBOT and can be multiples

[<b>NOTE:</b> There is no automatic unsubscribe (concept is that this was made for Emergency Communications)

NetMSG or MSG or NetMRG/MRG (normal typos) [space] [message] <-- to distribute message to list

NETUSERS  <-- Last 10 list of users

NETCHECKOUT  <-- to leave the list.

BLACKLIST ADD/BLACKLIST DEL <-- needs Admin Privileges

# Special Thanks to:

Ben Jackson, N1WBV for his assistance!!!!

# ToDo List:

I want to add a Store-Forward feature, which isn't that difficult, except can't gain the assistance of any AI to do it properly without major mission creep and unbelievable complexity.  The four major AI's have failed to achieve the goals and requirements of this feature.  Help is appreciated from real Python programmers...

The acutal coding was done by Gemini, Co-Pilot, ChatGPT and Perplexity AI.  I would not recommend using any of them given a multitude of issues from failure to comply with instructions, mission creep, rabbit holes (logic), and the list goes on...
