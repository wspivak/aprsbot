# About

Ioreth is a **very experimental** APRS bot. There is a lot f things to be
done yet, including writing the documentation. For now, you are welcome to
use it as you want.

Note that transmitting on the usual APRS ham bands requires (at least) an
Amateur Radio license and additional conditions and limitations for this
particular mode of operation may apply on your country or region. You MUST
ensure compliance with your local regulations before transmitting, but all
other uses are only subjected to the GNU GPLv3+ (see license bellow).

Connecting this program to the APRS-IS network also requires a license as
you will be, effectively, operating remote transmitters through the Internet.
